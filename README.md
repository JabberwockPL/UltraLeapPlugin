FreePIE plugin for Leap Motion/Ultraleap

This is a plugin for FreePIE designed to support the newer software for Leap Motion/Ultraleap hardware. It reads the position and velocity of hands and fingers, pinch and some other parameters.

Note that it is 64-bit plugin, so it will NOT work with the original FreePIE software.
